# powerbox
An alpine chroot for android users (requires root and busybox)

# why?
Because we can. Seriously, the base android system is so fucking bloated, so let's just create a chroot and forget about that shit. PowerBox is made specifically for android, because why not?

# how to use?
This script sets up a chroot and installs alpishell, a very nice utility.
to run it, just do:
```
``` 
and you should be done!

# how the fuck is the archive only 60mb?
because the alpine rootfs is small: only 3mb and the rest is just packages, plus the archove is compressed with gzip

# can i run services in it?
yep, it's set up for that so you don't have to worry about stuff

# (any other question here)
the alpine wiki should have all you need
